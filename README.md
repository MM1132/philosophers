# Philosophers
> The amazing 42 School project coded by Robert Reimann

Yes, I am the guy that took it into my hands to complete the Philosophers. It was not easy, and it took me about two weeks of hard work, yet pushed through I did and completed the project - I did. 

Here, in this GitHub repository, you can see my Philosophers solution (wihtout the bonus). Feel free to look at it, try to understand the code, and steal as much of it for your own Philosophers project as you want <3 I will not mind at all. 

Have fun!
